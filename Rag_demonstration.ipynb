      "The text discusses the disadvantage of linking images in a document. If the document is sent to another person or moved to a different computer, the image files must also be sent and placed in the correct location for them to be visible.

      "The text chunk discusses the process of inserting an image into a digital format using a scanner.\n",
      "The text provides instructions on how to insert a scanned image into a document using LibreOffice. This involves selecting the scan source from the list of available devices, choosing where in the document to insert the image, and adjusting image settings such as quality and size in the imaging software. The process is initiated from the Menu bar by following Insert > Media > Scan > Select Source, and then Insert > Media > Scan > Request.\n",
      "The text suggests that while a certain method is fast and simple, it may not produce high-quality, correctly sized images. It recommends scanning material into a graphics program, improving it there, and then inserting the image into LibreOffice for better results.\n",
      "The text chunk refers to the process of adding a picture from a collection or database, commonly known as a gallery.\n",
      "The Gallery in LibreOffice allows users to group reusable objects like graphics and sounds for easy insertion into documents. It is accessible in Writer, Calc, Impress, and Draw components. Users can either copy or link an object from the Gallery into their documents. More details can be found in \"Managing the LibreOffice Gallery\" on page 13.\n",

      "LibreOffice offers various tools for image manipulation including cropping, resizing, modifying, filtering, and positioning, as well as text wrapping and using images as backgrounds or watermarks. However, for more complex adjustments, it's recommended to use a separate image manipulation program and then import the results into LibreOffice.\n",
      "The text chunk discusses the process of modifying, handling, and positioning images, which is the ninth topic in the series.\n",
      "The Image toolbar appears when an image is inserted or selected in a document. It provides access to two other toolbars: the Image Filter toolbar and the Color toolbar. These toolbars allow users to make minor corrections, apply special effects like transparency, color adjustment, flipping, rotating, and special-effects filters to the image. For detailed information, refer to the Writer Guide.\n",
      "The text provides instructions on how to crop images in LibreOffice. There are two methods: using the Crop tool for a quick and easy process, or using the Crop tab of the Image dialog in Writer for more control. The Image dialog can be accessed by right-clicking on the image and selecting Properties. Further details can be found in the Writer Guide.\n",
      "The note explains that cropping an image in LibreOffice does not alter the original image, but merely hides parts of it. When exporting the document to HTML, the original, uncropped image is exported. To export the cropped image, one must refer to the \"Exporting (saving) images\" section on page 11.\n",
      "The text provides instructions on how to resize an image for a document by dragging the image's sizing handles.\n",
      "The text instructs to click on the image to display the sizing handles, if needed.\n",
      "The text instructs to place the cursor over one of the sizing handles, which will cause the cursor to change shape, visually indicating the direction of the resizing.\n",
      "The text instructs to resize an image by clicking and dragging it.\n",
      "The table/text provides tips on image resizing. Corner handles adjust both width and height simultaneously, while the other four handles modify one dimension at a time. Holding down the Shift key while dragging a handle maintains the image's original proportions.\n",
      "The text suggests using the Type tab in the Image dialog for more precise image resizing.\n",
      "The text provides instructions on how to quickly flip or rotate an image by right-clicking on it and selecting the desired option from the Rotate or Flip submenu.\n",
      "The text states that Writer, a component of LibreOffice, offers more rotation options compared to other components. Further details can be found in the Writer Guide.\n",
      "Chapter 5, titled \"Working with Images and Graphics\", is the tenth chunk of the text.\n",
      "The Image dialog feature in Writer consists of ten different tabs.\n",
      "The text provides instructions on defining the size and anchor of an image, as well as its position on a page.\n",

The \"Ctrl\" key in Windows/Linux corresponds to the \"⌘ (Command)\" key in macOS, and the \"Alt\" key in Windows/Linux corresponds to the \"⌥ (Option)\" or \"Alt\" key in macOS, depending on the keyboard. These keys are used in combination with other keys.\n",
